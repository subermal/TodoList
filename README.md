# Task Manager App

## Overview
This is a Task Manager application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to manage tasks efficiently by providing the following features:

- Add tasks to the list
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Filter tasks by status (All, Active, Completed)

The tasks are saved using `localStorage`, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

- **Complete a task**: Click the green checkmark button to mark a task as completed.
- **Delete a task**: Click the red delete button to remove a task.
- **Filter tasks**: Use the filter buttons to view all tasks, only active tasks, or only completed tasks.
